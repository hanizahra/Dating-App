### User Stories
1. As an introvert, I'm too nervous to say hi to a stranger, but if I know he/she might like me, I can do it.  
2. I dont have time to schedule and commit to dates. I'm more likely to be interested in meeting someone new (who I know likes me) in the moment.   
3. I like meeting new people but I don't want to bother complete strangers. If they swipe, I'm more game to make an introduction.
